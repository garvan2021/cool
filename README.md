## 4. Do you want to make a functional web page?
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)  
"Flask will never have a database layer. It will not have a form library or anything else in that direction. Flask itself just bridges to Werkzeug to implement a proper WSGI application and to Jinja2 to handle templating. It also binds to a few common standard library packages such as logging. Everything else is up for extensions.  
Why is this the case? Because people have different preferences and requirements and Flask could not meet those if it would force any of this into the core. The majority of web applications will need a template engine in some sort. However not every application needs a SQL database.  
The idea of Flask is to build a good foundation for all applications. Everything else is up to you or extensions."
